# PlasmaPong Refactor

My attempt to clean up an ancient DOS game a friend and I made in high school.

## Goals

### Phase 1

- Use the same compiler (was it MSVC 6.0? Borland?)
- Rearrange things to be more sane, but still one file
- Don't change any functionality unless preserving bugs makes refactoring more complex

### Phase 2

- Upgrade to modern C++ compiler & graphics subsystem
- Fix problems
